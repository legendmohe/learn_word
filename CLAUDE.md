# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This appears to be a new "learn_word" project for vocabulary/word learning functionality. The repository is currently empty and ready for initial development.

## Development Setup

Since this is a new project, you'll need to:

1. Initialize the project structure based on the intended technology stack
2. Set up package management (npm, pip, etc.) as appropriate
3. Create initial project files and directories

## Common Commands

Commands will be added here once the project structure and technology stack are established.

## Architecture

Project architecture details will be added as the codebase develops.

## Notes

- This is a fresh repository with no existing code
- Focus on establishing proper project structure first
- Consider what type of word learning functionality is intended (flashcards, quizzes, vocabulary tracking, etc.)
